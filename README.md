# Sales-Prediction-Using-ANN

The two copies of the jupyter notebok files do basically the same thing save for one difference. The feature scalling for copy one is minmax scaler while the copy 2 uses a standard scaler.

The notebooks run on a tensorflow backend.

To Run them you need create a separate environment and install the foollowing in that environment.

Tensorflow
Keras
Scikit Learn
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
